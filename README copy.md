# Employee Tracker


#Using mysql we are to create a database of employees, role, and departments to store and interact with the information through node. First my index.js has my main info asking to view, change, add or update employee data. My sql page employee_tracker I create the tables for the job departments, role, and employee info along with the inserts to the page. And when I run node I can view the tables of the info I passed in.

#I was able to create the veiw sections of the table but I was struggling with trying to add info because we couldnt use express and that was the only way I knew how to add new info.

#Just show me where to code so I can add and update the info.
